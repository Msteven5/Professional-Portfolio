      <article id="about-me">
        <p>My name is Michael, and I have been interested in the tech field for a while, with a specific interest in coding. I have had friends that introduced me to the concept, after having preconceptions for years that it was not something that I would be able to accomplish. After reaching the breaking point after years in retail, I made the leap to switch career paths to become a Web Developer. In this portfolio, you will see how much I have accomplished towards my task. This is where I will be keeping my completed projects done throughout the coding bootcamp that I am working through, as well as any fun projects I have done on my own or with friends.</p>
